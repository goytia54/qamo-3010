# Practice Problems

## Question 1

### Q1.a Derive the firm’s inverse demand equation.

### A1.a
* y = 67.67 - 5.34(price)

### Q1.b What is the value of R-squared? In a sentence, explain what R-squared means

### A1.b
* R squared is 0.734, it is the dependability of the model and how it accounts for all factors versus the left overs which is just noise.

### Q1.c Is the price variable statistically significant at the 5% level? How do you know this?

### A1.c 
* Yes, because we can see the p values are quite less than 0.05 indicating the null hypothesis is not true and thus there is an effect of each coefficient in the model

### Q1.d Suppose the firm’s profit-maximizing price is $6.89 and their marginal cost is $2. What is the firm’s own-price elasticity of demand?

### A1.d
ε=−0.7091​≈−1.41


## Question 2

### Q2.a
* Assuming the marginal cost of this product is $10, what would you suggest as an optimal price
for this firm to set?
